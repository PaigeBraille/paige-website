# We had another exciting month at Paige!

We are excited to share with you the progress we made in February and the new developments we have in store for you.

We are thrilled to announce that we have a new team member, Nina Rimsky, who is a software engineer with extensive experience in building accessible and user-friendly web apps. With Nina on board, we are confident that we can deliver a top-notch user experience with our product, Paige Connect.

In February, we tested Paige Connect with New College Worcester and a SEND local offer. We were thrilled to receive positive feedback on the usability and accessibility of the product. We are committed to ensuring that our product meets the needs of all our customers, and these tests helped us validate our approach.

We are proud to announce that we have received funding from DIF Capital Partners through the Allia Accelerator Program. This funding will help us accelerate our growth and expand our reach to more customers. We are grateful for the support we have received and are committed to delivering value to our customers.
