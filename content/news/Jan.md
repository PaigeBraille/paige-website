# We kicked off the new year with a bang!

We are excited to share with you the progress we made in the past month and the developments we have in store for you.

**Team Spotlight**

In January, we focused on building a prototype for our first product, Paige Connect. Our team worked tirelessly to ensure that the prototype meets our high standards and the needs of our customers. We are confident that the product will exceed your expectations, and we can't wait for you to try it out!

**Progress**

We launched our socials and website on World Braille Day, and we are thrilled to have received such positive feedback from our customers. We are grateful to have partnered with Baker McKenzie for pro-bono trademarking, which helps us protect our brand and products.

**Thank you**

We are proud to announce that we have received funding from Young Innovators and RAEng 1851 Royal Commission Enterprise Fellowship. This funding will allow us to accelerate our growth and continue to innovate for our customers. We are grateful for the support we have received, and we are committed to delivering value to our customers.
