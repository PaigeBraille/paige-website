# My story

**Who are you?**

I am Sean Randall, a totally-blind Braille-loving teacher at a school for the blind and visually-impaired. I teach IT and support students with accessibility.

**How did you first hear about Paige Connect?**

 I’ve watched the ideas for Paige Connect grow from the design stages with great excitement, and am hugely pleased to see a product come to market that’s going to be so useful to many, many people.
 
**What were your first impressions?**

That Paige Connect is such a simple idea. It really just does one thing, but in doing it well, Paige Connect will open doors to education, potentially for thousands of people.
 
**How would you use it?**

At home, I’d use it to jot down notes, play word games with my sighted daughter, perhaps make shopping lists or take down numbers or information from phone calls or printed material I’d need to refer back to later on in Braille.  Professionally, I rarely teach the Perkins, but I have had to do Braille assessments and cover classes and for those, I’d use Paige Connect so I could read what my student was writing without having to hover my hand over their Brailler or wait for the paper copy.
 
**What would you say to anyone interested in getting one?**

If Paige Connect can meet your needs it will be an amazing addition to a Braille journey. If you are supporting a young person in their learning, needing to learn Braille yourself as an adult, or an accomplished Braillist with a Perkins you want to make a little smarter, Paige Connect could be the product for you.
