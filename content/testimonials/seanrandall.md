# My story

**Who are you?**

I am Sean Randall, a totally-blind braille-loving teacher at a school for the blind and visually-impaired. I teach IT and support students with accessibility.

**How did you first hear about Paige Connect?**

 I’ve watched the ideas for Paige Connect grow from the design stages with great excitement, and am hugely pleased to see a product come to market that’s going to be so useful to many, many people.
 
**What were your first impressions?**

That Paige Connect is such a simple idea. It really just does one thing, but in doing it well, Paige Connect will open doors to education, potentially for thousands of people.
 
**How would you use it?**

At home, I’d use it so my  sighted daughter an view what I'm writing in braille or to write notes that I can store digitally to refer back to later. Professionally, I’d use Paige Connect so I could read what my student was writing through the web app without having to wait for the paper copy.
 
**What would you say to anyone interested in getting one?**

If you are supporting a young person in their learning, needing to learn braille yourself as an adult, or an accomplished braillist with a braille writer you want to make a little smarter, Paige Connect could be the product for you.
