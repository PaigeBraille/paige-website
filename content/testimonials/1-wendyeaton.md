excerpt: '"If you are working in a school with a student it will save you so much time, you can just use the app to read what has been brailled in print – no more transcribing underneath a line of braille! You also don’t need to know braille to use it, so if the usual TA is off sick anyone can retrieve the students work."'

# My story

**Who are you?**

Technical resource officer at the East Sussex Sensory Needs Service.

**How did you first hear about Paige Connect?**

The Braillists Foundation forum.

**What were your first impressions?**

Very good, definitely fills a gap in the market.

**How would you use it?**

As a service we would use it in schools so the teacher can see what the student is embossing with their braille writer.

**What would you say to anyone interested in getting one?**

If you are working in a school with a student it will save you so much time, you can just use the app to view what has been brailled by the student – no more transcribing underneath a line of braille! You also don’t need to know braille to use it, so if the usual TA is off sick anyone can retrieve the students work.
